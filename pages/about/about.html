    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This website was created to serve the community of people who are interested in the hobby of papercraft,
        and provide a single, unified location to find and learn more about the hobby. This is something that the
        hobby seems to lack, due to how spread out all the models are, an how scarce it is to find a website that is
        up-to-date with the latest web design and usability trends.
