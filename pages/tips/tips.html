        <h2>What tools do I need?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A printer.</li>
            <li>A cutting tool.</li>
            <li>Craft/PVA glue.</li>
            <li>A cutting mat. (optional)</li>
            <li>Scoring tools (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        Just a quick note with glues, if you do opt for PVA glue, make sure that it is not diluted.
        Some cheaper brands tend to do this which results in the glue dissolving the ink in the paper as well as causing wrinkling.
        <h2>What paper should I be using?</h2>
        This depends on what model you are creating, but basic 150gsm with no gloss should work for most projects.
        If the model is large, it is better to use thicker paper and vice-versa for smaller projects.
        For an extremely sturdy finish, you can glue the printed paper onto cardboard to reinforce it as neccessary.
        <h2>What should I start with?</h2>
        For your first papercraft, I reccomend making a simple model, no more than 1 page in size.
        At first a cooler model might seem tempting, but they are a very large undertaking that can take up to a week to fully complete.
        Don't bite off more that you can chew.
        <h2>Other useful tips:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do a practice cube before you start:</li>
            This will greatly decrease the chance of you making a mistake during actual production.
            <li>Test everything:</li>
            Cut out small snips of paper and glue them together, or test whatever method you intend to use on your model, before you actually do it.
            <li>Cut tabs freely:</li>
            The tabs shown after printing may seem like they need to be cut to their exact shape, but in the end they will be hidden. So to save time, cut them as simply as possible.
