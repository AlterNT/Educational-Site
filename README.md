# Papercraft Website - Year 12 Project

## Purpose and Goals

The original goal of this assignment was to create a website to showcase and explain a chosen hobby.

In my case, I chose papercraft as this was one I had past experience doing.

Once again, I took this as an excuse to work on my styling skills to meet a certain objective / art-style. Furthermore, I constructed a (rather crude) simple framework to neatly organize my code for each pages. This utilises shadow DOMs to create self contained 'elements' that are swapped out by the main page.

## Application Stack

- HTML - Structure
- CSS - Styling
- JS - Functionality

## Functionality

I believe that I met the design criterion sufficiently for this project, being primarily more of a design showcase than a functional site.
A breakdown of my design choices are the following:

- Flat, muted colors, similar to that of colored paper.
- Box shadows and panels to imitate sheets of paper.
- Tabs shaped in those of cutouts for navigation.
- Dotted outlines resembling crease outlines on certain elements.

## Deployment

This is a static website, only file hosting is needed.

The site is currently availible to view [here](https://alternt.github.io/Year-12-Papercraft-Site/).
